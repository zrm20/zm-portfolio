    description: "Nomi Travel was a start up tech company in Nashville and my first software development position. At Nomi I was responsible for building the web app using React, as well as back-end REST services for the web app. I also built an internal database management app using a full MERN stack that managed database CRUD operations for 3 environments. I also gained experience in test driven developement, CI/CD, Heroku deployment and Git actions. Nomi was an excellent start-up with tremendous potential. The company is currently on hold, awaiting further capital.",

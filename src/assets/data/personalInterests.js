    popoverText: 'One of favorite hobbies has always been fishing. Growing up in Minnesota fishing was a big part of my childhood. As an adult it has become both entertainment and therapeutic for me. I enjoy any and all freshwater fish, but my addiction is muskie fishing.'

    icon: faShip,
    popoverText: 'While I primarily boat for fishing, I do enjoy just taking a boat on the lake and cruising. I own a simple 16 foot fishing boat, but it is perfect for what I need. I also enjoy kayaking and canoeing.'

  {
    name: 'Hiking',
    icon: faPersonHiking,
    popoverText: 'Hiking has always been a hobby of mine but in recent years I have also taken on backpacking. Backpacking has been a big challenge and has also been incredibly rewarding. I have enjoyed many unbelievable views because I was willing to put in the work to get there.'

    name: 'Gaming',
    icon: faGamepad,
    popoverText: "While I don't game as much as I used to, I still consider gaming a hobby of mine. I used to prefer FPS games like Halo and Call of Duty, but now my go-to games are open world and story driven games."

  {
    name: 'Camping',
    icon: faCampground,
    popoverText: "Camping is a great way for me to get away and enjoy the great outdoors. Most of the time camping is a part of another hobby like fishing or hiking. Many times I will camp near a lake that I'm fishing or other times it might be backpacking."

    name: 'Woodworking',
    icon: faHammer,
    popoverText: "Woodworking was a new hobby that I developed over the COVID pandemic. I never saw myself as a carpenter, but I started doing some DIY projects and started to enjoy it and get better. My proudest work currently is a 5 foot walnut river table desk that I build out of a local rough cut walnut slab."

    name: 'Football',
    icon: faFootball,
    popoverText: "I'm a big NFL football fan. Of course growing up in Minnesota my number 1 team is the Minnesota Vikings. Cheering for the Vikings, while difficult at times, is a big tradition for me and my dad and we try to enjoy going to a game at US Bank Stadium every year."

  {
    name: 'Hockey',
    icon: faHockeyPuck,
    popoverText: "Growing up in Minnesota, hockey is big! I played hockey from 5th grade through high school. I played goalie my high school team and I still enjoy watching NHL hockey today. My team is the Minnesota Wild."

    name: 'Climbing',
    icon: faMountain,
    popoverText: "Rock climbing is a new sport for me but I really enjoy it. While I'm not a huge risk taker, rock climbing is an excellent workout and a fun challenge. I don't do a lot of outdoor climbing but when I do, I enjoy taking care of all of the rigging and safety equipment."

      `At Nomi Travel, I worked as a Full Stack Developer, responsible for building a web application using React and developing back-end REST services with Node.js, Express and MongoDB. I gained experience in creating reusable React components on the front-end, and a maintainable MVC architecture on the back-end.  I implemented test-driven development using Jest, ensuring acceptable code coverage. Nomi helped me develop a thorough understanding of React and its core principles as well as DevOps experience implementing CI/CD using Heroku and GitHub actions. At the fast paced startup environment we practiced Agile methodology and worked to prioritize tasks while remaining flexible.`,

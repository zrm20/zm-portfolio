  `I have always had a passion for music, but my skills lie in tech. From an early age I knew I wanted to get into the music business. I decided to go to Belmont University to study Audio Engineering Technology. This career path felt like an excellent fusion of passion and skills for me.
As a student at Belmont I spent my first 2 years taking any opportunity I could to get time behind a console. Whether it was a late night in the studio assisting another engineer or an early morning load-in for a show in the arena, I saw every chance to be behind a console as an essential part of my education.
After my second year at Belmont, I applied for an internship with touring country artist Justin Moore. I spent the summer as an intern and after the summer I was hired on as the monitor/patch tech. I finished my last two years of school juggling a full time student schedule and a full time touring schedule.
After graduation, I was promoted to the monitor engineer position. At this time we were regularly touring as a small headlining act as well as a direct support act for large arena tours such as Miranda Lambert's platinum tour and Brad Paisley's Crushin' It tour.
In 2018 I was promoted to stage manager, in addition to keeping my monitor engineering role. As the stage manager I oversaw audio, lighting and video departments load in and load out. While my standard touring crew was 5-7 people, during arena tours I oversaw a crew of 12-15 members and local crews up to 30.
In addition to my touring experience I have worked various freelance events for companies like OrangeThread Media, Special Event Services and CTSAudio for both corporate and festival events.

        My background is not the typical background of a software engineer. After completing a degree in Audio Engineering Technology I started my career in touring live sound. I spent 8 years touring as an audio tech, monitor engineer and stage manager before the 2020 pandemic shut the touring industry down entirely. It was at that time I started to pursue other career paths.

        One career that felt both familiar and intriguing was audio for video games. As I started to research what it takes to start that career, I first needed to learn to program. Game engines like Unity use C# to script logic, so to learn to implement audio to games I first needed to understand the basics of C#. After spending a few weeks working through a C# book, I decided that I was enjoying the programming so much, I had lost interest in the idea of audio for games, and that I should start to pursue programming on its own.

        I considered enrolling in a programming bootcamp at Nashville Software School, however due to the pandemic all classes were online. And the price tag on the bootcamp was intimidating for someone who was unemployed at the time. As someone who is very self-motivated, I felt that I could take advantage of the free and low-cost learning options the internet has to offer today.

        I examined the curriculum of NSS’s bootcamp and determined I needed to cover the basics (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) before choosing a backend specialty. I picked out a bootcamp course offered on Udemy. This course was over 60 hours and covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express and MongoDB for a full project.

        After completing that course, I decided that I wanted to focus on mobile app development. After considering the various options of Swift, Kotlin or Xamarin, I decided on React for its wide popularity and flexibility of web-apps as well as native apps with React Native. I then enrolled in a React and React Native course on Udemy.

        Over the course of this I decided to take on my first solo app. As an avid backpacker, I wanted to make an app for keeping an inventory of camping equipment. I developed Trail Pack Pro, a React Native app that can inventory and manage the weight values of all of your gear.

        Since working on my first app, I went on to work for a Nashville start up, Nomi Travel. At Nomi I am responsible for two React web-apps as well as the back-end API’s that support them with Node, Express and MongoDB.

        I am a person that is always striving to learn more. I now own a library of hundreds of hours of Udemy content. At all times, I am working on at least one course. I love learning new things and am always looking forward to a new challenge.
